      content: Thank you for taking part in this listening test.
        <br><br>
        In this experiment, we are interested in evaluating the use of a new audio playback
        method for consuming TV programme content in domestic settings.
        <br><br>
        The test consists of a series of TV programme items, where each item has a number of conditions
        that are to be rated on a numerical scale from 0 - 100. The test is split into two sections,
        where each section will evaluate a single attribute. You are welcome to have a short break 
        between the two sections. Before the test begins, there will be a practice example so you can 
        familiarise yourself with the test interface.
    - type: volume
      id: volume_page
      name: Volume
      content: Use the slider below to set volume level for the audio items in the test.
        It should be set at a comfortable level for you. <strong>You are not allowed to adjust the volume
        after this point.</strong> So take time to ensure that the volume is appropriate.
        <br>

        When you are ready, please press 'Next'.

      name: Practice Example
      content: This is a practice example outlining how to use the test interface. Please take your 
        time to familiarise yourself with the interface and controls.
        <br><br>
        At the top of the interface is a waveform view which indicates the position of the playhead
        on the stimulus. The bar below the waveform can be used to shorten or lengthen the loop
        region of the stimulus by dragging the two braces to the desired position. Each condition
        has a play/pause button and a rating slider. The buttons can be toggled using the mouse or
        by pressing the spacebar. You can move between conditions by using the mouse or by using
        the left and right arrows. The slider can only be adjusted when the corresponding condition
        is selected, and can be moved using the mouse or the up/down arrow keys.
        <br><br>
        If you have any questions, please ask the facilitator. Once you are happy with the interface
        and the test format, please press 'Next' and proceed with the test.
